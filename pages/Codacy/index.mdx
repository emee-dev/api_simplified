# Introduction to Codacy

## What is Codacy?

Codacy helps you and me ensure we write good quality code, and with the help of their AI tools you can find issues easier.

### The Need for Codacy

JavaScript, though highly flexible, lacks strict typing to catch common errors early in development. TypeScript fills this gap by introducing static typing, serving as a safety net to prevent subpar JavaScript code.

## Key Features of TypeScript

1. **Enforce Coding Standards:**
   On every pull request you can be certain the code is of desirable quality.

2. **Integrations:**
   They have support for most of your favourite developer tools and programming languages.

3. **Find Vulnerabilities:**
   Codacy also helps us find vulnerabilities you may have overlooked while coding.

## Getting Started with Codacy

To start using Codacy, you'll need to have a `github` or `bitbucket` or `gitlab` or `google account`:
