## Creating an account?

Creating a new account was intuitive and it took me less than 5 minutes to add my repositories. I followed the steps on the screen and was prompted by
github to grant them (Codacy) permissions to be able to view my projects, which I did obviously.

## Configuration

You can add your git provider so they will be able to get the repositories from your account.

## Adding a repository

On the dashboard you will have the see a card of organisations you are affiliated with, I used my personal account which was
also listed in the organizations dashboard view. Click the add button to add it your personal git provider account.
