## Adding an account?

Creating a new account was intuitive and it took me less than 5 minutes to add my repositories.

## Configuration

You can add your git provider so they will be able to get the repositories from your account.

## Adding a repo

On the dashboard you will have the see a card of organisations you are affiliated with, I used my personal account which will
also be listed in the organizations dashboard view.
