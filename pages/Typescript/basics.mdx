## Utility Functions

TypeScript utility functions do specific tasks, helping us write less repetitive code.

## `Record<Type, Type>`

The Record utility type helps us describe the helps us define the type for the keys and values of an object.

```ts utilities.ts {1} copy
type Dog = Record<string, number>;
const speedy: Dog = {
	age: "ks", // it will throw an error
};
```

```ts utilities.ts {7} copy
enum Colors {
	Red = "red",
	Green = "green",
	Blue = "blue",
}

type ColorMap = Record<Colors, string>;
const colorCodes: ColorMap = {
	[Colors.Red]: "#FF0000",
	[Colors.Green]: "#00FF00",
	[Colors.Blue]: "#0000FF",
};
```

## `Pick<Type, keysof_Type>`

The Pick utility type helps us create a new type by allowing us pick the keys from an existing type

```ts utilities.ts {8} copy
type UserProfile = {
	userId: number;
	username: string;
	email: string;
	isAdmin: boolean;
};

type PublicProfile = Pick<UserProfile, "userId" | "username">;
const publicProfile: PublicProfile = {
	userId: 123,
	username: "john_doe",
	// Other properties like email and isAdmin are not allowed here.
};
```

## `Omit<Type, keysof_Type>`

The Omit utility type helps us create a new type by allowing us exclude the keys from an existing type.
`This way we won't have to manually create a new type declaration`

```ts utilities.ts copy
type UserProfile = {
	userId: number;
	username: string;
	email: string;
	isAdmin: boolean;
};

type PrivateProfile = Omit<UserProfile, "username">;
const adminProfile: PrivateProfile = {
	userId: 1199200388393,
	email: "example@gmail.com",
	isAdmin: true,
	// Other properties like username is not allowed here.
};
```
